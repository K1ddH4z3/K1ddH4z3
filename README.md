## I'm [Light](https://github.com/Light-YT/)
I founded the [Sharingan-Team](https://github.com/Sharingan-Team/).                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I developed my first jailbreak and now I'm trying, but in Swift XD.                                                                                                                                                                             
I have a repo that contains a lot of Tweaks and 2 Exploit in demo version.                                                                                                                                                                                               
Now besides developing [PsychoBreak](https://github.com/Light-YT/PsychoBreak) I'm developing a lot of tweaks that will be available on my [repo](https://repo.sharingan.ml).       
# After releasing LightSn0w and PsychoBreak I will stop developing Jailbreak
